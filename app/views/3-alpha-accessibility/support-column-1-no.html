      <p>Access to Work gives extra help to make work easier if you have a disability or health condition. If you do not need extra help to make it easier for you to do your work, then you are not eligible for Access to Work.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You may be eligible for one of the following services:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance">Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</a>, if you have a disability or health condition that affects how much you can work</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a>, if you have a health condition or disability that prevents you from working or preparing for work</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</a>, if you have a long term physical or mental health condition or disability</li>
        </li>
