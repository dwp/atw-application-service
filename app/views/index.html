                      <p style="color:white">2a was the lowest rated support-based prototype. In general, users liked
                        how it provided accessible options from the very start, but they were keen to highlight that
                        options were missing from the list. In addition, the prototype did not make it clear what

Therefore, we are comfortable to iterate these design going forward. The one negative piece of feedback was from a dyslexic user who commented that there was a high amount of text on the help screen.</p>

                      <p>GitHub: <i><a

                      <p>Team Sparrow spoke to many users during the discovery phase and it was clear that the level of
                        support currently on offer by GOV and DWP is currently not good enough. For example, 15% of
                        claimants are deaf or hard of hearing and 12% of claimants are blind or have difficulty seeing.
                        This emphasises the importance of developing an accessible-by-default service. The aim of these
                        prototypes is to test how users react to being offered support or a bespoke application journey at
                        the start of their application. Currently we are unsure on how to offer the support, hence a
                        number of prototypes are to be tested and iterated on over time.</p>

                      <p>This prototype directly asks the claimant their preferred application method
                        before they start their application. For example, someone who is dyslexic, may prefer to have a
                        phone call instead of filling out a digital form.

                      <p>It has become increasingly apparent that case managers struggle with the 'niche' employment
                        types. For example there are complexities if someone is applying for Access to Work via the
                        <b>Department for Education supported internship</b>, and even more complexities if they are
                        applying for this internship from <b>Wales</b>.</p>

                      <p>Case managers have stated that over time a lot of different employment-types have been stappled
                        onto Access to Work. If a 'niche' employment type emerges in an application it can be very
                        confusing, complex and time consuming for both the applicant and advisor.</p>

                      <p>We believe that by asking for some personally identifiable information during the eligibility

                        ask for their National Insurance number we can route it to a back-end API to instantly check if
                        they are eligible from an age, citizenship and benefit-status perspective.</p>

                      <p>Our concern is that claimants may not want to reveal so much identifiable information during
                        the eligibility stage and there may be some GDPR and security considerations.</p>

                      <p>Different services throughout Government do eligibility checks differently. We are interested
                        in whether eligibility should be highlighted to the claimants once they have done their
                        eligibility check. Or alternatively, should eligibility seamlessly flow into apply.</p>

                      <p>This prototype takes inspiration from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge">Apply
                        for Blue Badge</a> service which contains a "you may be eligible" holding page, with information
                        on what you need to do for the "start application" (apply) stage.</p>

                      <p>It is also hypothesized that if we make the claimant aware that they "passed eligibility", they
                        will be understanding/forgiving if they get asked a similar question during apply e.g. if we ask
                        the claimant during eligibility-checking if they are "16 or over" (to avoid asking for personal
                        information), they will be forgiving when asked for their date of birth during apply.

                  <p>Since the alpha accessibility and eligibility prototypes have
                    tested very well, we are comfortable to proceed with the apply journey. Having engaged with
                    policy and key DWP stakeholders, we have a rough remit to start exploring how we design the apply
                    service. The aim of these prototypes are to test a series of designs that work well for the
                    claimants, advisors and workplace assessors.</p>

                  <p>The following designs are based on the scenario that the user knows what support they need from Access to Work. The current thinking is that we will allow someone to book a workplace assessment if they don’t what support they need.</p>

                      As 1b, the task list, was our riskiest assumption, we began prototyping and testing this first. It has tested so well that currently we do not see the need to prototype an end-to-end journey without the task list component. As 1a would be similar to the existing application journey, we have decided to put this idea on hold until we have decided whether to move forward with the task list component.

                  <p>This prototype is an end-to-end application process that makes use of the <a

                    pattern</b></a>
                    for the user to complete their application once they have passed eligibility. This design asks about the user’s needs for every element of Access to Work and is quite lengthy, hence the use of the task list pattern.</p>

                  <p>This design currently assumes that save and return functionality would be possible.</p>
