                  <p>GitHub: <i><a
                          href="https://github.com/dwp/atw-application-service/tree/main/app/views/2-alpha-accessibility" target="_blank">/2-alpha-accessibility</a></i></p>
                  <p>Team Sparrow spoke to many users during the discovery phase and it was clear that the level of
                    support currently on offer by GOV and DWP is currently not good enough. For example, 15% of
                    claimants are deaf or hard of hearing and 12% of claimants are blind or have difficulty seeing.
                    This emphasises the importance of developing an accessible-by-default service. The aim of these
                  prototypes is to test how users react to being offered support or a bespoke application journey at
                    the start of their application. Currently we are unsure on how to offer the support, hence a
                    number of prototypes are to be tested and iterated on over time.</p>

                  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2a. How would you prefer to apply?</h3>
                  <p>This prototype directly asks the claimant their preferred application method
                    before they start their application. For example, someone who is dyslexic, may prefer to have a
                    phone call instead of filling out a digital form.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2b. Do you need support completing this application?</h3>
                <p>The aim of this prototype is to ask the claimant at the start of their application on whether they
                  need support or not. If they require support, we want to test an Access to Work accessibility
                  information page.</p>

            <p class='govuk-body'>User Research and an in-depth Design review on the current Live service Team Sparrow
              inherited highlighted several key concerns:
            </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Many potential claimants were not applying for Access to Work because they believed that they
                were not eligible</li>
              <li>Many users were making claims despite not being eligible</li>
              <li>When filling out the application, many users would get rejected half way through their
                application (having wasted a lot of time filling out details prior to the question that rejected them).
                This is bad design.</li>
              <li>A lot of time is currently being wasted by advisors who have to do some back-end investigations
                into if the claimant is eligible for Access to Work. This indictaed that the current live service
                is not designed optimally.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The aim of this section of alpha is to uncover the best and simplest ways to determine the eligibility
              of a claimant</p>

                  <p>It has become increasingly apparent that case managers struggle with the 'niche' employment
                    types. For example there are complexities if someone is applying for Access to Work via the
                    <b>Department for Education supported internship</b>, and even more complexities if they are
                    applying for this internship from <b>Wales</b>.</p>

                  <p>Case managers have stated that over time a lot of different employment-types have been stappled
                  onto Access to Work. If a 'niche' employment type emerges in an application it can be very
                    confusing, complex and time consuming for both the applicant and advisor.</p>

                  <p>Our hypothesis is that: we believe that identifying and separating out unique job types at the
                    start of an application will result in a better application experience and work out if someone
                    is genuinely eligible.</p>

                  <p>The <a href="/alpha-eligibility-control/do-you-live-in-gb">control prototype</a> asks all the questions that are

                    control prototype does not ask for any personally identifiable information.</p>

                  <p>We believe that by asking for some personally identifiable information during the eligibility
                    stage, we can ask fewer questions and make the application process simpler. For example if we
                    ask for their National Insurance number we can route it to a back-end API to instantly check if
                    they are eligible from an age, citizenship and benefit-status perspective.</p>

                  <p>Our concern is that claimants may not want to reveal so much identifiable information during
                    the eligibility stage and there may be some GDPR and security considerations.</p>

                  <p>Different services throughout Government do eligibility checks differently. We are interested
                    in whether eligibility should be highlighted to the claimants once they have done their
                    eligibility check. Or alternatively, should eligibility seamlessly flow into apply.</p>

                    for Blue Badge</a> service which contains a "you may be eligible" holding page, with information
                    on what you need to do for the "start application" (apply) stage.</p>

                  <p>It is also hypothesized that if we make the claimant aware that they "passed eligibility", they
                  will be understanding/forgiving if they get asked a similar question during apply e.g. if we ask
                    the claimant during eligibility-checking if they are "16 or over" (to avoid asking for personal
                    information), they will be forgiving when asked for their date of birth during apply.

                  <p>We believe that claimants who are ineligible will need screens with information into why they
                    are ineligible. We are keen to test the structure, layout and format of these screens.</p>
